# Betting-Dashboard
Dashboard developed with NodeJS and NuxtJS in order to keep track of your past bets. In order to setup the project locally, please read the readme files in the "back" and "front" directories.

## Overview
This project was made with the objective of tracking your betting history. In this plataform you can register your bets by selecting the league, teams, match date, bet value, bet odds, bet type (Moneyline or Total) and your prediction.

After you register your bets, you can check their result in the bets table, where the outcome of each bet is displayed.

For the bets to receive an outcome, the result of the match must be registered in the matches table so the system can update the result of every bet related to that particular game. The only matches that are going to be displayed in this table are the ones that are yet to receive a result update.

Finally, you can track your profit as the time passes in the bets dashboard. In this page, you can also check the total value invested and total profit of your bets.
